Hello there and welcome my worspace, punk.
Linux Mint and metal lover.
Here is where I'll be working on my personal projects, work related projects and my "fun" stuff.
I also write and read books because I was meant to be a writer, go to college and all that stuff, but I renounced having a girlfriend and social life to study Java. Yes.
I like dinosaurs and scarecrows.
